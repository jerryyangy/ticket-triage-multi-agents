# ticket-triage-multi-agents
This is a project that orchestrates multiple AI agents using Microsoft Foundry Agent Service. It's to design an AI solution that assists with ticket triage. The connected agents will assess the ticket’s priority, suggest a team assignment, and determine the level of effort required to complete the ticket.
